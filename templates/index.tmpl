<h2>Hi, my name is Rawley.</h2>
<p>
	I am an independent full-stack developer from Canada. Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science, with hopes of participating in a graduate program.
</p>
<p>
	I am a GNU/Linux and OpenBSD enthusiast. I am active in both the Debian and Void GNU/Linux communities. My favourite programming languages are Go and Clojure. You can check out my work on <a href="https://gitlab.com/rawleyIfowler">GitLab</a>. I am currently working on an open-source community based blogging network called <a href="https://gitlab.com/xrn">xrn</a>.
</p>
<p>
	When I'm not programming, I'm either reading, cooking, playing table-top games, or walking my dog.

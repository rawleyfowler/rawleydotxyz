# [rawley.xyz](https://rawley.xyz)
This is my personal website and blog. It is written entirely in Go and
hosted on a Fedora Linux server, reverse proxied through NGiNX. It is designed to be one-hundred-percent Javascript free, and be usable by text based browsers like [lynx](https://lynx.browser.org).

## Contributing
I will only accept bug fixes. This site is my own, so I will be declining any design oriented or feature requests.
Issues are always welcome as long as they're technical, issues regarding my blog posts, etc, will be ignored. This project only compiles with go version `>=1.17`.

## Blog
I try my best to make a blog post every 15 or so days. My blogs content ranges from technical to non-technical; some of it will be informative and some if it will be observatory.
If you like my blog or have a question feel free to send me an email at rawleyfowler@gmail.com.

## Donate
There is a donation section to my website, currently I only accept BTC but eventually I'll probably support Monero. Donations are cool, but I only really have that page there so I can remember my BTC wallet.

## Copyright
I reserve the right to the content that is hosted on [rawley.xyz](https://rawley.xyz). This means you can't copy my blog posts. However, I do give permission to anyone to use content on my blog for any purpose, as long as I am mentioned, either by inline citation or disclaimer.

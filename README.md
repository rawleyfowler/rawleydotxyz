This is my personal website and blog. It is written entirely in Go and hosted on a 1 core, 1 gb of ram OpenBSD machine, reversed proxied through NGiNX.

## Contributing
I will only accept bug fixes. This site is my own, so I will be declining any design oriented merge requests.

## Blog
I try my best to make a blog post every 15 or so days. My blogs content ranges from technical to non-technical; some of it will be informative and some if it will be more observatory.
If you like my blog or have a question feel free to send me an email at rawleyfowler@gmail.com.

## Donate
There is a donation section to my website, currently I only accept BTC but eventually I'll probably support Monero.
